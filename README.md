We all love to surf the Internet. Most of the times, we come across some cool awesome websites which we tend to bookmark for future use. And I love to say that I'm no exception to this behavior.

Since I have found so many such awesome websites throughout my journey in this vast ocean we call Internet, I would like to share my collection with you all. I hope you will like this cool collection of mine and don't forget to star my repo!

Most of the websites are just for fun and some are very useful for specific purposes. Though I have written brief information about it in front of the link which I hope will grow your curiosity. Enjoy and do share this cool collection with your friends ðŸ™‚

#Introduction to Employee Management System Using C++

Employ management system using C++ is menu driven program which allows us to add, update, delete and search record of an employee working in an organization. The program employee management system store employee ID, name, post, department and salary of employee. Initially, it has no data. Thus, we have to add employee records choosing appropriate option in this program (i.e. selecting option #1).

Employee Management system using C++ program uses EmpID as unique identifier (i.e. primary key) to recognize employee. So, we can’t add two employees having same ID. After successful entry of records of some employee, we can search record on the basic of ID or department. We can search particular employee from ID choosing option #2 and if we want to see all employee working in a department, we have to choose another option (i.e. option#3 in menu). We can list all employee records also using option #4 in menu. Again, we can update and delete existing record. Thus, this project is useful to mange employee records in an organization.
